This application uses PDO to retrieve and display records in a database table. The database (pcparts) is provided
in the projects folders

The project initially displays a web page with a form for specifying a city. Submitting the form should output 
all fields in the customers table for customers in the specified city.

1.) Download pcparts.sql from Module 2. Use PHPMyAdmin to import pcparts.sql.

2.) Create a pcparts user named parts_dude with password P@rtzer. Give this user at minimum privileges select.
